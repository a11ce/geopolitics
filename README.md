*Geopolitics* is a game for two players. Each player is the leader of a
superpower (U.S.A and U.S.S.R., Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, etc)
and competes to conquer the other by diplomatic, covert, or military
means.

Each turn (month) each player chooses one **domestic policy** and one
**foreign policy** action. **Domestic policy** actions are resolved
without the intervention of the other player, and **foreign policy**
actions may or may not require a choice to be made by the other player.
Both players choose their actions and resolve **domestic policy**
actions simultaneously, and alternate the order in which **foreign
policy** actions are resolved.
