Notes
---------------------

- While the descriptions in this document may seem to suggest a certain setting, the rules of the game are applicable to any conflict between powers with mutually assured destruction. Agree upon a setting before playing and choosing nations to play as.
- XdY denotes the sum of one roll each of X Y-sided dice. If agreed upon before playing, it may denote instead X times one random integer between 1-Y inclusive, but this may change gameplay.
- The order of foreign policy actions in each turn does not matter.
