<p><em>Geopolitics</em> is a game for two players. Each player is the leader of a superpower (U.S.A and U.S.S.R., Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, etc) and competes to conquer the other by diplomatic, covert, or military means.</p>
<p>Each turn (month) each player chooses one <strong>domestic policy</strong> and one <strong>foreign policy</strong> action. <strong>Domestic policy</strong> actions are resolved without the intervention of the other player, and <strong>foreign policy</strong> actions may or may not require a choice to be made by the other player. Both players choose their actions and resolve <strong>domestic policy</strong> actions simultaneously, and alternate the order in which <strong>foreign policy</strong> actions are resolved.</p>
